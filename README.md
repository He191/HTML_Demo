Flex Container
I learned how to use Flex Containers and their child. Also learned the use of justify-content: space-between property to evenly space the child elements.

justify-content: space-evenly; 
I used this to Distribute space evenly between text items in a FlexBox.

z-index
I used z-index to set text over the image

Flexbox - first-child
By default properties of all the flex items / child of Flexbox container are same. I used First child to increase the font size and change other properties of first flex item, so that it stands out as logo. Similarly other commands like nth child and last child are also used for that specefic flex item.

hover
I used this command to set formatting values when mouse is hovered over that element. This is to give nice button like feeling to Buttons in the page.

scroll-behavior: smooth; 
I used this command to Enables smooth scrolling in the page.

Nav and Section:
I used Section tags to use them in the nav tags to navigate in the various sections of the website.
